Copy any .png files into this directory

Edit in ImageLoading.js:
-the array of file names (can at terminal use:
ls *.png > tileList.txt
...or the same idea with dir in DOS to generate list of all files in the folder)
-dimensions that ImageLoading is wording with, including margin of dimensions mismatch it'll accept (currently is +/- 3 to catch some that weren't exact matches)
-rows and cols values to form sheet of whichever dimensions are needed

console log will report which files were skipped due to not fitting
